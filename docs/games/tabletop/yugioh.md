# Yu-Gi-Oh!

## Rulings

### Necrovalley and Horus monsters (inherent summons from the graveyard)

While [Necrovalley] is active,
[Horus] monsters cannot be special summoned from the graveyard with their [inherent summon] effect:

> Imsety, Glory of the Horus:
> _If you control "King's Sarcophagus", you can Special Summon this card (from your GY)._

Even if inherent summons are non-activated effect (they do not start a chain),
they are still effects and are therefore negated by Necrovalley:

> Necrovalley:
> _Negate any effect that would move a card in the GY to a different place._

On the other hand,
Necrovalley cannot negate **summoning condition** such as [The Bystial Lubellion]'s:

> The Bystial Lubellion:
> _Must be Special Summoned (from your hand or GY) by Tributing 1 Level 6 or higher DARK Dragon monster._

### Pendulum Monsters under Macro Cosmos

The game rules state that

> Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field
> (regardless of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not)
> would be sent to the Graveyard,
> place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead.

[Macro Cosmos] (or [Dimension Shifter]) redirection
apply on top of the redirection of Pendulum monsters
and then banishes them when they hit the graveyard (before they are placed on the Extra Deck).

Keep in mind that Pendulum cards are placed face-up in the Extra Deck
**only if they are sent from the field**.
This is the reason why you can use Dragon Shrine to foolish [Darkwurm]
to activate its graveyard effect.
