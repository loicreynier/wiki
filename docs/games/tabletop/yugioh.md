## Rulings

### Buster Blader Swordsman vs The Ultimate Creature of Destruction

[Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman] imposes the following lock on Dragon monsters:

> Change all Dragon monsters your opponent controls to Defense Position,
> also Dragon monsters in your opponent's possession cannot activate their effects.

In the OCG text, it states instead that

> Your opponent cannot activate the effects of Dragon-type monsters.

This means that the second part of the lock affects the player and not the monster.
They cannot activate the effect of Dragon monsters.
According to Jeri Sama,
the consensus in TCG is that "X monster cannot activate its effects" always affect the player.
In that way, if a Dragon monster is made unaffected by card effects
with cards such as [The Ultimate Creature of Destruction] or Number 81,
it would be possible to change it to Attack Position
but not to activate its effects under the Buster lock.

### Necrovalley and Horus monsters (inherent summons from the graveyard)

While [Necrovalley] is active,
[Horus] monsters cannot be special summoned from the graveyard with their [inherent summon] effect:

> Imsety, Glory of the Horus:
> _If you control "King's Sarcophagus", you can Special Summon this card (from your GY)._

Even if inherent summons are non-activated effect (they do not start a chain),
they are still effects and are therefore negated by Necrovalley:

> Necrovalley:
> _Negate any effect that would move a card in the GY to a different place._

On the other hand,
Necrovalley cannot negate **summoning condition** such as [The Bystial Lubellion]'s:

> The Bystial Lubellion:
> _Must be Special Summoned (from your hand or GY) by Tributing 1 Level 6 or higher DARK Dragon monster._

### Pendulum Monsters under Macro Cosmos

The game rules state that

> Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field
> (regardless of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not)
> would be sent to the Graveyard,
> place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead.

[Macro Cosmos] (or [Dimension Shifter]) redirection
apply on top of the redirection of Pendulum monsters
and then banishes them when they hit the graveyard (before they are placed on the Extra Deck).

Keep in mind that Pendulum cards are placed face-up in the Extra Deck
**only if they are sent from the field**.
This is the reason why you can use Dragon Shrine to foolish [Darkwurm]
to activate its graveyard effect.

### Hieratic Seal and Spell Cards (Return Spell Card to Hand)

When a Normal, Quick-Play or Ritual Spell Card, or a Normal or Counter Trap Card is activated,
it cannot be returned from the field to the hand during
that chain unless it has an effect that would cause it to remain on the field after activation,
such as Swords of Revealing Light.

For that reason Hieratic Seal cannot bounce Spell/Traps cards unless there are Continuous Spells.
