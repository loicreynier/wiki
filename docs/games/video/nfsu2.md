# Need for Speed Underground 2

## Modding

### Releases (and warez)

Most NFSU2 mods requires version 1.2 and vanilla release
is preferred to be sure of the mods/patches installed.
Most warez releases unfortunately contain pre-installed mods:

- `Need.For.Speed.Underground.v1.2.HOODLUM-elamigos`:
  vanilla installation
  supposed to contain HOODLUM NO CD v1.2 crack
  but requires the ISO to be mounted
- `Need.for.Speed.Underground.2.v1.2-blaze69`:
  vanilla installation
  supposed to contain HOODLUM NO CD v1.2 crack
  but requires the ISO to be mounted
- `Need.for.Speed.Underground.2.v1.2us-Pioneer`:
  Russian pre-cracked and pre-modded
  (widescreen fix, extra options...) version
- `Need.for.Speed.Underground.Dilogy-RG-Mechanics`:
  can't be sure of the version[^1]
  and comes with a different widescreen patch than usual

The `[FRENCH] NO-CD/FIXED Exe` patch provided by [GameBurnWorld]
combined with the `elamigos` release
allows running the game without a mounted ISO
and seems to be compatible with an English installation;

[^1]: version could be checked by loading a mod requiring v1.2
